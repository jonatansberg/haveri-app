# Haveri — Brand Outline

## The Name

**Haveri** (Swedish: *haveri*, noun) — a breakdown, a failure, an incident. Originally from maritime language (ship damage), now used colloquially for anything that goes spectacularly wrong. "Det blev ett haveri" — *it became a disaster*.

The name works on multiple levels:

- **Immediate recognition** for Scandinavian audiences (your initial market)
- **Phonetically appealing** internationally — sounds warm, not clinical
- **The ironic tension is the brand.** You name your product after the thing nobody wants, because your thesis is that pretending incidents don't happen is what makes them catastrophic. Haveri says: *incidents are normal, let's get good at them.*

## Brand Narrative

### The Problem (the old world)

Something breaks. Someone messages the group chat. Chaos. Three people troubleshoot in parallel without knowing what the others are doing. The shift supervisor calls the production manager at 2 AM. It gets fixed — somehow. Nobody writes down what happened. Two months later, the same thing breaks. Nobody remembers the fix. The cycle repeats.

Incidents are treated as emergencies, as failures, as someone's fault. So people hide them, downplay them, and dread them. The organizational response to incidents *is itself the disaster*.

### The Transformation (what Haveri enables)

Haveri takes the drama out of incidents by giving them structure. When something breaks, there's a clear path: declare it, triage it, work it, resolve it, learn from it. The right people get involved at the right time — not too early (panic), not too late (crisis).

Over time, the haveri becomes something else entirely. It becomes data. It becomes institutional memory. It becomes the reason you *don't* have a haveri next month, because the pattern was caught and the root cause was fixed.

**The brand arc:**

```
HAVERI → structure → calm → learning → prevention → fewer haverier
```

### The Tone

Haveri's voice is **the calm, competent colleague** — the one who doesn't panic when the line goes down, who asks the right questions, who writes things down so the team doesn't have to remember everything under stress.

- **Confident, not corporate.** We don't say "leverage synergies in incident response workflows." We say "stop losing fixes to group chat chaos."
- **Dry humor, not silly.** The name is already tongue-in-cheek. The product can afford to be warm and occasionally wry without trying too hard.
- **Respectful of the work.** Manufacturing people build real things. The tone never talks down, never implies they're behind the times, never positions tech as the savior. The framing is: *you already know how to fix things — we just make sure the knowledge sticks.*
- **Anti-dramatic.** The whole point is that incidents shouldn't be dramatic. The brand reflects this: understated, steady, clear.

## Tagline Candidates

**Primary candidates:**

- **"From haveri to handled."** — The transformation in four words.
- **"Incidents happen. Chaos doesn't have to."** — States the thesis directly.
- **"Your last satisfying haveri."** — Playful. The product makes incidents so well-managed they become almost... satisfying?

**Supporting lines (for landing page, feature sections, etc.):**

- "Every incident is a lesson. Haveri makes sure you actually learn it."
- "The fix your team figured out at 3 AM shouldn't disappear into a group chat."
- "Less firefighting. More fire prevention."
- "Turn tribal knowledge into team knowledge."
- "Structure the chaos. Keep the expertise."

## Visual Identity Direction

### Personality Keywords

Calm. Capable. Warm. Understated. Scandinavian. Industrial-meets-modern.

### Color Direction

Avoid the usual SaaS blue. Avoid aggressive reds and oranges (those signal *alarm*, the opposite of the brand). Instead:

- **Primary:** A deep, warm slate or charcoal — grounded, industrial, calm
- **Accent:** A muted amber or warm gold — warmth, alertness without panic, the glow of a controlled situation
- **Severity mapping:** Use color functionally for incident severity (red/amber/green), but the *brand* palette stays calm
- **Background:** Warm off-whites or very light warm grays — Scandinavian, clean, not sterile

### Typography Direction

- **Headings:** Something with character but not decorative. A clean geometric sans with slightly rounded terminals reads as modern + approachable. Think along the lines of: Inter, General Sans, Satoshi, or similar.
- **Body/UI:** Highly legible, works at small sizes (operators on phones). System fonts are fine in the product itself.
- **Avoid:** Anything that looks like enterprise software (rigid, corporate) or startup-cute (bubbly, playful).

### Logo Direction

The name itself is the logo. "haveri" in lowercase — confident enough to not need capitalization. Possible treatments:

- **Wordmark only.** Clean, typographic. Lowercase "haveri" in a distinctive weight. The simplicity *is* the statement — no drama, no fuss.
- **Optional icon:** An abstract mark that suggests containment or resolution. A circle closing, a line stabilizing, something that reads as "this is under control." Not a warning symbol, not a shield, not a hard hat. Those belong to the old world of incident-as-emergency.
- **Avoid:** Anything that looks like safety signage, hazard symbols, or emergency response imagery. Haveri is the *after* — the calm, structured response.

### Illustration / Imagery Style

- **No stock photos of people in hard hats looking at tablets.** This is the visual language of every legacy EHS tool and it signals "enterprise software you'll hate using."
- **If using illustration:** Simple, line-based, warm. Scenes of calm coordination, not crisis. Think: a timeline assembling itself, a notification reaching the right person, a pattern emerging from data.
- **In the product:** Let the UI be the brand. Clean, spacious, information-dense where needed but never cluttered. The incident timeline view is your signature — it should feel like reading a well-organized logbook, not a chaotic feed.

## Positioning

### One-liner
Haveri is incident management for teams that build real things — structured, chat-native, and designed to make your operation smarter with every incident.

### Who it's for
Production managers, shift supervisors, and operations teams at small to mid-size process industries who currently manage incidents through group chats, phone calls, and memory.

### What it replaces
The WhatsApp group. The 3 AM phone call. The spreadsheet someone started and nobody maintains. The knowledge that walks out the door when a senior operator retires.

### Why now
Chat platforms (Teams, Slack) are already where these teams communicate. LLMs can now extract structure from natural conversation. The building blocks exist to give non-tech industries the same incident management quality that software teams have had for years — without the enterprise price tag or the 6-month implementation.
