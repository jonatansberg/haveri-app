  <h1 class="text-4xl font-semibold text-slate-900">About Haveri</h1>
  <p class="text-lg text-slate-600">
    We build for teams running physical operations where incidents have immediate safety and output impact.
  </p>
  <p class="text-slate-700">
    Our belief is simple: operators should not have to choose between fast response and good documentation.
    Haveri keeps declaration, escalation, timeline capture, and follow-ups in one place.
  </p>
  <p class="text-slate-700">
    We are a small team focused on practical software that works in real shifts, not just clean demos.
